\section{Introduction}	
Improper waste management has severe effects on our environment, natural resources and public health. In our project we take pictures of waste items and output semantic labels detecting and classifying the objects.
In this report, we experimented with different sizes of ResNet, and choose ResNet34 as it gave optimal accuracy of 93\%. Later for object localization, we used Faster RCNN with Inception V2 as the backbone network.

\section{Related work}

\citep{yang2016classification} and \cite{chu2018multilayer} in describe network architectures based on AlexNet. We found the following limitations in these approaches: Images used for testing in \citep{yang2016classification} and \cite{chu2018multilayer} have only one object per image.  
Misclassification of certain classes of objects (e.g., misclassifying cylindrical objects as recyclable objects). 
Cenk Bircanoglu et. al in \cite{bircanouglu2018recyclenet} uses MobileNet, a streamlined architecture which can be used in smart devices. This idea is useful as we also want to deploy our network on smartphones. 



\section{Dataset and Features}
We use TrashNet \citep{yang2016classification} dataset as the baseline. This dataset has 6 labelled classes (Glass, Paper, Cardboard, Plastic, Metal, Trash). We augment this dataset by adding more categories (mentioned in Problem Statement) to it.  After we collect more data (by taking photos with our smartphones) and ensure that our data is preprocessed to match the resolution of TrashNet[4] dataset. 



\section{ Methods }

\subsection{Generating Collages}

\subsubsection{Random Collage Generation}

We have a hand labeled collage generated.

    \end{subfigure}
    
    \label{fig:random_collage}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Learned Collage}
% Add 2 branch network
Here we try to pose the problem of generating collage as a Knapsack problem. We want to optimize the collage such that the overlap between the two images is minimized. To do this we first get foreground masks of the original image. Since the images in the dataset are not centered, we register all the images such that the bounding box starts at the top left corner. We find out the $t_{x}$ and $t_{y}$  from the top left corner of the bounding box. Later by affine transform, we translate the image such that the top left corner is $(0,0)$. Note we have negated the values of  $t_{x}$ and $t_{y}$  to so that the output moves to the top left.

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
x'\\
y'
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & -t_{x}\\
0 & 1 & -t_{y}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x\\
y\\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.2\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{data/images/section_4_Learned_Collage/base_original.png}
     \caption{Original Image}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.2\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{data/images/section_4_Learned_Collage/original_mask.png}
    \caption{Registered mask}

    \caption{Registered mask}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Collecting the data to set up the problem}
  \label{fig:learning_collages}
\end{figure}


Now we define a collage loss, so that we have minimum overlap and maximum union area between the foreground. 
\begin{equation}
intersection = base_{mask} \bigcap target_{mask}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
union = base_{mask} \bigcup target_{mask}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
collage_{loss} = \frac{intersection}{union}
\end{equation}

For every ground truth, we define following anchor points by defining a grid over the image, and then finding the above loss function for each of these points. 

\begin{equation}
anchor_{loss} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
l_{1} l_{2} l_{3} \ldots 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    optimal_{anchor} = argmin(anchor_{loss})
\end{equation}

We use this optimal anchor point as the ground truth for our learning the optimal place for placing the target. A sample output is shown on page \pageref{fig:learned_collage_output}

    \label{fig:learned_collage_output}
    \caption{Learned network and sample output collage}
\end{figure}

Though this approach was promising at first, it did not work for the following reasons. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Since we registered the images, the output location was always the same. All generated collages looked very similar. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Blending collages}
To blend different masks on a collage we experimented with a pre-trained GP-GAN \cite{wu2019gp}. A sample output can be seen in \pageref{fig:GAN_Blending}

\section{Classification of Objects}
TrashNet \cite{yang2016classification} reports only 63\% accuracy for classification on the test set, this can be mainly attributed to its comparatively simple CNN model. We reproduced the results from \cite{CollinChing} where ResNet34 was used to do classification of objects in TrashNet dataset  \cite{yang2016classification} and got better results than \cite{CollinChing}. 

As ResNet \cite{he2016deep} performs better on image classification tasks, we applied transfer learning on ResNet models with weights pre-trained on ImageNet dataset as a baseline. We froze all the layers except the fully connected layers at the top, and the network was finetuned to TrashNet dataset. 

We experimented with different number of layers of ResNet. We noticed that using deeper ResNet does not yield significant improvements in test set accuracy and concluded that ResNet34 was a good sweet spot. 

We used FastAI \cite{howard2018fastai} library to search for an optimum learning rate and fit using one cycle optimization algorithm \cite{1CyclePolicy}. The plots of losses and other metrics are shown below. 

\subsection{Hybrid Transfer Learning}
We use a Hybrid approach to Transfer Learning from \cite{geron2019hands}. For trying this out, we start with pretrained models on image net. Then add a Global Average Pooling layer, followed by Batch Normalization, then Dense output layer. We start by freezing all base layers, and training the output layer by a large learning rate, then after a few epochs, we 

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwResult{Learned Model }
 base =  pretrained model \;
 
 avg = GlobalAveragePooling(base) \\
 reg = BatchNormalization(avg)
 output = Dense(number of classes, activation="softmax", input=reg)

 Freeze base layers of the downloaded model\;

 \While{epochs < 10}{
 train the model with a very high learning rate; 
 }
 
 Unfreeze all base layers; 
 
 \While{epochs < 100}{
 train the model with a very low learning rate; 
 }
 \caption{Hybrid transfer learning}
\end{algorithm}

The advantage of this approach is that it does not change the weights of the base layers drastically in the first few epochs when the last few layers have not yet stabalized. 

\section{Experiments/Results/Discussion}

\subsection{Learning Rates}

\begin{itemize}
    \item LR-Find
    \item LL Decay
    \item Reduce Learning Rate on Plateau
    \item Learning Rate Schedule
    
\end{itemize}

Comparison between different classification algorithms

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{data/images/Section_5_Comparision/Classification_plot.png}
    \caption{Comparing of validation accuracy between different classification learning algorithms. \cite{Zoph_2018}  \cite{Huang_2017} \cite{howard2017mobilenets} \cite{he2016deep} \cite{simonyan2014deep} \cite{chollet2017xception} }
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

We can see that the DenseNet has the highest validation accuracy. We also see different number of epochs, this is because we are using EarlyStopping \cite{geron2019hands}, hence if the validation accuracy does not imporve we stop the training to save time and compute resources.

You should also give details about what (hyper)parameters you chose (e.g. why did you
use X learning rate for gradient descent, what was your mini-batch size and why) and how
you chose them. What your primary metrics are: accuracy, precision,
AUC, etc. Provide equations for the metrics if necessary. For results, you want to have a
mixture of tables and plots. If you are solving a classification problem, you should include a
confusion matrix or AUC/AUPRC curves. Include performance metrics such as precision,
recall, and accuracy. For regression problems, state the average error. You should have
both quantitative and qualitative results. To reiterate, you must have both quantitative
and qualitative results! If it applies: include visualizations of results, heatmaps,
examples of where your algorithm failed and a discussion of why certain algorithms failed
or succeeded. In addition, explain whether you think you have overfit to your training set
and what, if anything, you did to mitigate that. Make sure to discuss the figures/tables in
your main text throughout this section. Your plots should include legends, axis labels, and
have font sizes that are legible when printed.
